Hello, I’m Gilbert Han, a postgraduate student at Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. My research focuses on applying genomic techniques to solve issues related to cell differentiation, particularly in bone development. I also work on bioinformatics method development, including Python packages like TrajAtlas and linkSet. Recently, I’ve been diving into 3D genomics. I’m currently in Yufeng Zhang's lab and have a close collaboration with Huan Liu's group.

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and reading. I consider myself a bit of a geek with broad interests in social science, psychology, statistics, and non-fiction. I love engaging in deep conversations, so I look forward to discussing ideas with you!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
