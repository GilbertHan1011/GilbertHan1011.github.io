Hello, I’m Gilbert Han, a postgraduate student at Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. My research focuses on applying genomic techniques to solve issues related to cell differentiation, particularly in bone development. I also work on bioinformatics method development, including Python packages like [TrajAtlas](http://trajatlas.readthedocs.io) and [linkSet](https://gilberthan1011.github.io/linkSet/). Recently, I’ve been diving into 3D genomics. I’m currently in [Yufeng Zhang&#39;s lab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_eK1fEwAAAAJ&hl=en) and have a close collaboration with [Huan Liu&#39;s group](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ohO3wKIAAAAJ&hl=en).

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and reading. I consider myself a bit of a geek with broad interests in social science, psychology, statistics, and non-fiction. I love engaging in deep conversations, so I look forward to discussing ideas with you!
