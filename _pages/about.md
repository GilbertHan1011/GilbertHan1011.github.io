Hello, Iâ€™m Gilbert Han, a postgraduate student at Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. My previous research focuses on applying genomic techniques to address issues related to cell differentiation, particularly in bone development. This work was recently accepted by PLOS Genetics! I also work on bioinformatics method development, including Python packages like [TrajAtlas](http://trajatlas.readthedocs.io) and [linkSet](https://gilberthan1011.github.io/linkSet/). Recently, Iâ€™ve been diving into 3D genomics. 

In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and reading. You're welcome to explore [my book collection](https://gilberthan1011.github.io/books/); here are some books I'd like to recommend to you. I love engaging in deep conversations and look forward to discussing ideas with you!
