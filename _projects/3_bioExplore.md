I created this [website](https://gilberthan1011.github.io/nav/) as a comprehensive collection of bioinformatics resources, encompassing tutorials, tools, databases, and other valuable materials. Having taught myself bioinformatics through various open-source resources, I understand the challenges of learning this field independently. By curating and sharing these resources in one place, I hope to support others who are embarking on their own bioinformatics journey and make their learning path smoother.

I made five basic categories:

- **Genomics**: A comprehensive collection of resources and tutorials for various bioinformatics analysis pipelines, including scRNA sequencing, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, and other cutting-edge genomic techniques.
- **Statistics**: In-depth learning materials and tutorials covering statistical methods and machine learning approaches commonly used in bioinformatics research and data analysis.
- **Programming**: Detailed guides and tutorials for essential programming languages in bioinformatics, including Python, R, and shell scripting, with practical examples and best practices.
- **Community**: A curated list of insightful blogs, active social media accounts, and other valuable community resources that provide ongoing learning and networking opportunities.
- **Biology**: A carefully selected collection of authoritative textbooks and references covering fundamental topics in genetics, epigenetics, and related biological fields.

If you have any suggestions or resources to contribute, please let me know! I'm always looking to expand and improve this collection to make it more helpful for the bioinformatics community.
