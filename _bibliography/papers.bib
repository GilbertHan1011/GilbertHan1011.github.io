  abstract = {Osteoblasts, the key cells responsible for bone formation and the maintenance of skeletal integrity, originate from a diverse array of progenitor cells. However, the mechanisms underlying osteoblast differentiation from these multiple osteoprogenitors remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a comprehensive framework to investigate osteoblast differentiation at multiple scales, encompassing cells, genes, and gene modules. We constructed a reference atlas focused on differentiation, which incorporates various osteoprogenitors and provides a seven-level cellular taxonomy. To reconstruct the differentiation process, we developed a model that identifies the transcription factors and pathways involved in differentiation from different osteoprogenitors. Acknowledging that covariates such as age and tissue type can influence differentiation, we created an algorithm to detect differentially expressed genes throughout the differentiation process. Additionally, we implemented methods to identify conserved pseudotemporal gene modules across multiple samples. Overall, our framework systematically addresses the heterogeneity observed during osteoblast differentiation from diverse sources, offering novel insights into the complexities of bone formation and serving as a valuable resource for understanding osteogenesis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mitochondria are the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells, which regulate cell metabolism and differentiation. Recently, mitochondrial transfer between cells has been shown to direct recipient cell fate. However, it is unclear whether mitochondria can translocate to stem cells and whether this transfer alters stem cell fate. Here, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) regulation is examined by macrophages in the bone marrow environment. It is found that macrophages promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by delivering mitochondria to MSCs. However, under osteoporotic conditions, macrophages with altered phenotypes, and metabolic statuses release oxidatively damaged mitochondria. Increased mitochondrial transfer of M1-like macrophages to MSCs triggers a reactive oxygen species burst, which leads to metabolic remodeling. It is showed that abnormal metabolism in MSCs is caused by the abnormal succinate accumulation, which is a key factor in abnormal osteogenic differentiation. These results reveal that mitochondrial transfer from macrophages to MSCs allows metabolic crosstalk to regulate bone homeostasis. This mechanism identifies a potential target for the treatment of osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Deep burns are one of the most severe skin wounds, with typical symptoms being a contradiction between initial severe pain and a subsequent loss of sensation. Although it has long been known that sensory nerves promote skin regeneration and modulate skin function, no proven burn management strategies target sensory nerves. Here, a neuro-inspired biomimetic microreactor is designed based on the immune escape outer membrane of neuroblastoma cells and neural-associated intracellular proteins. The microreactor is constructed on a metal--organic framework (MOF) with a neuroblastoma membrane coating the surface and intracellular proteins loaded inside, called Neuro-MOF. It is loaded into a therapeutic hydrogel and triggers the release of its content proteins upon excitation by near-infrared light. The proteins compensate the skin microenvironment for permanent neurological damage after burns to initiate peripheral nerve regeneration and hair follicle niche formation. In addition, the neuroblastoma cell membrane is displayed on the surface of the Neuro-MOF microreactor, decreasing its immunogenicity and suppressing local inflammation. In a mouse model of deep skin burns, the Neuro-MOF microreactor exhibited significant functional skin regeneration effects, particularly sensory recovery and hair follicle neogenesis.}
