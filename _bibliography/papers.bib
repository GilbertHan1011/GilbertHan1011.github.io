  abstract = {Osteoblast differentiation is crucial for bone formation and maintaining skeletal integrity. Although it is now understood that this process exhibits significant heterogeneity across developmental stages and tissue microenvironments, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we introduce TrajAtlas, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap in knowledge. TrajAtlas comprises four modules: a reference atlas (Differentiation Atlas), a differentiation model (Differentiation Model), a tool for differential pseudotime analysis (TrajDiff), and a method for pseudotemporal gene module detection (TRAVMap). By leveraging single-cell technologies, TrajAtlas offers a systematic approach to exploring the multi-scale heterogeneity among cells, genes, and gene modules within population-level trajectories across diverse tissues and age groups. We systematically investigate the impact of age and injury on osteogenesis, providing new insights into osteoporosis and bone regeneration. In conclusion, our comprehensive framework offers novel insights into osteogenesis and provides a valuable resource for understanding the complexities of bone formation.Author Summary Osteoblasts, the cells responsible for bone formation, can originate from various cellular sources. However, it's unclear how different progenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts, and how this process is influenced by factors such as age and tissue location. This knowledge gap stems from the lack of comprehensive databases and tools to decipher the differentiation process. In this study, we introduce TrajAtlas, a comprehensive framework designed to bridge this gap. To explore the cellular origins of osteoblasts, we constructed an atlas centered on osteogenesis. To answer how progenitor cells differentiate to osteoblasts, we developed a model that reveals the dynamic regulatory landscape during this process. To elucidate the influence of age and tissue location on differentiation, we built a tool for differential analysis. Furthermore, to identify conserved patterns of differentiation, we developed an approach to detect pseudotemporal gene modules. We validated the effectiveness of this framework by applying it to more datasets, unveiling novel cell states associated with injury. Notably, this framework focuses on dynamic processes, with the potential for broader applications in studying cell differentiation and complementing cell-centric analyses.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Mitochondria are the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells, which regulate cell metabolism and differentiation. Recently, mitochondrial transfer between cells has been shown to direct recipient cell fate. However, it is unclear whether mitochondria can translocate to stem cells and whether this transfer alters stem cell fate. Here, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) regulation is examined by macrophages in the bone marrow environment. It is found that macrophages promote osteogenic differentiation of MSCs by delivering mitochondria to MSCs. However, under osteoporotic conditions, macrophages with altered phenotypes, and metabolic statuses release oxidatively damaged mitochondria. Increased mitochondrial transfer of M1-like macrophages to MSCs triggers a reactive oxygen species burst, which leads to metabolic remodeling. It is showed that abnormal metabolism in MSCs is caused by the abnormal succinate accumulation, which is a key factor in abnormal osteogenic differentiation. These results reveal that mitochondrial transfer from macrophages to MSCs allows metabolic crosstalk to regulate bone homeostasis. This mechanism identifies a potential target for the treatment of osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Deep burns are one of the most severe skin wounds, with typical symptoms being a contradiction between initial severe pain and a subsequent loss of sensation. Although it has long been known that sensory nerves promote skin regeneration and modulate skin function, no proven burn management strategies target sensory nerves. Here, a neuro-inspired biomimetic microreactor is designed based on the immune escape outer membrane of neuroblastoma cells and neural-associated intracellular proteins. The microreactor is constructed on a metal--organic framework (MOF) with a neuroblastoma membrane coating the surface and intracellular proteins loaded inside, called Neuro-MOF. It is loaded into a therapeutic hydrogel and triggers the release of its content proteins upon excitation by near-infrared light. The proteins compensate the skin microenvironment for permanent neurological damage after burns to initiate peripheral nerve regeneration and hair follicle niche formation. In addition, the neuroblastoma cell membrane is displayed on the surface of the Neuro-MOF microreactor, decreasing its immunogenicity and suppressing local inflammation. In a mouse model of deep skin burns, the Neuro-MOF microreactor exhibited significant functional skin regeneration effects, particularly sensory recovery and hair follicle neogenesis.}
