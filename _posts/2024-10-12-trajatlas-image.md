Osteoblasts arise from multiple cellular origins, yet the pathways through which various progenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts remain unclear. This study constructs a comprehensive single-cell atlas and introduces an innovative algorithm to investigate the osteoblast differentiation process. Illustrated in this conceptual cartoon, inspired by the Waddington landscape and lineage tree, four distinct progenitor sources—chondrocytes, mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, and LepR+ bone marrow stromal cells—descend the lineage tree, ultimately converging into osteoblasts.
