I have a talented sister who is good at drawing. So, when PLOS Genetics asked me to provide a striking image, I turned to her for help. The result was... well, not very scientific, but extremely cute!

This picture was inspired by the Waddington landscape and lineage tree, four distinct progenitor sources—chondrocytes, mesenchymal cells, fibroblasts, and LepR+ bone marrow stromal cells—descend the lineage tree, ultimately converging into osteoblasts.
